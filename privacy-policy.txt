Information Collection and Use

I do not collect, store, or share any personal data from users directly. However, the Game makes use of third-party services that may collect information used to identify you. (I don't even know how to do that.)

These third-party services include:

Google Play Services

AdMob


These services may collect information such as your device identifiers, IP address, and usage data in order to provide features like achievements, leaderboards, analytics, and personalized advertising.

Children’s Privacy

The Game is not knowingly directed toward children under 13. If you believe a child has provided personal information through the third-party services, please review the policies of those services for steps on managing or deleting such data.

Security

Since I do not personally collect or store your data, there is no risk of your data being shared or sold by me. Data collection and storage is managed entirely by Google’s services under their own policies.
